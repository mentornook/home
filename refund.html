      <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date: 1 April 2025</strong></p>

      <p>At MENTOR NOOK, we strive to provide a fair and transparent refund and cancellation process for both students and teachers. This policy outlines the conditions under which refunds are issued and service charges are applied.</p>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>1. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>If a class is disrupted due to a technical error or any other dispute, the refund will be calculated based on the time the class was successfully conducted. The fee distribution follows this structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The total fee paid by the student is divided based on the actual class duration.</li>
          <li>The company deducts 15% from the tutor’s earnings as a platform service fee.</li>
          <li>The company deducts 5% from the student’s refund as a service charge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example Calculation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Total Fee Paid by Student: 100 bucks</li>
          <li>Class Duration: 1 hour (60 minutes)</li>
          <li>Actual Class Time Held: 40 minutes</li>
          <li>Time Ratio: 40/60 = 2/3</li>
          <li>Proportional Tutor Earnings: (2/3) × 100 = 67 bucks</li>
          <li>Company’s 15% Fee from Tutor: 67 × 15% = 10.05 bucks</li>
          <li>Company’s 5% Fee from Student: (100 - 67) × 5% = 1.65 bucks</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Final Distribution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tutor Receives: 67 - 10.05 = 56.95 bucks</li>
          <li>Student Refund: (100 - 67) - 1.65 = 31.35 bucks</li>
          <li>Company Earns: 10.05 (Tutor Fee) + 1.65 (Student Service Charge) = 11.7 bucks</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>2. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If a class is canceled before it starts, the student will receive a refund after deducting a 10% service charge.</li>
          <li>If a class is canceled mid-session, the refund will be calculated based on the time ratio as described above.</li>
          <li>If a teacher cancels a class, students receive a full refund minus the 10% service charge as a penalty to the tutor.</li>
          <li>If a student cancels a class, students receive a full refund minus the 10% service charge.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>3. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If a student or teacher violates platform policies (e.g., abusive language, prohibited content, rule violations), they will not be eligible for a refund.</li>
          <li>If a student fails to attend the class without prior notice, no refund is issued.</li>
          <li>If a tutor fails to conduct a class without valid reasoning, they may face penalties.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
